<p style="font-size: 180%;">Long time ago, <strong>Bilewater</strong>’s waters were pure and untainted, but the waste flowing down from the Citadel eventually corrupted them. The pollution spread through the area, harming the creatures that once lived peacefully in its depths.

    Among Bilewater’s original inhabitants is the Stilkin tribe, led by their chieftain, <strong>Groal the Great</strong>. The Stilkin harbor deep resentment toward the Citadel for letting its filth poison their home.
    
    A Snail Shaman once ventured into Bilewater seeking to form an alliance with the Stilkin against the Citadel. However, Groal the Great killed the Shaman and absorbed his soul to gain greater power.
